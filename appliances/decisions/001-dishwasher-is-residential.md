# Dishwasher is 

## Context and Problem Statement

We often entertain, cook many-dish meals and use our dishwasher for sanitizing things like canning jars. Current residential bosch does a great job but many of the cycles take a long time. Many items are large and tend to require a new minimal load to complete.

## Decision Drivers

* Ability to do quick loads 
* Ability to sanitize
* Being able to clean large items along with small

## Considered Options

* Higher end residential
* High temp commercial
* Low temp commercial

## Decision Outcome

- To be determined

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Higher end residential

Example: Bosch 800 series, Miele

* ✅ Quiet and well insulated
* ✅ Cheaper. 1-2k range
* ✅ Lots of organization. Easy to load/unload
* ✅ Dishes dry well
* ✅ Hookups are standard
* ❌ Water use is 2-4G per load even when half load selected. Miele down to ~2
* ❌ Cycles can take multiple hours. Express is around 30 min
* ❌ Parts may be harder to find

### Commercial

Example: Hobart or Noble 

* ✅ Cycles tend to be 10 minutes
* ✅ Can fit almost everything
* ✅ Tends to use < 1 gallon per load but multiple loads are needed.
* ✅/❌ Standard dish holders (but need place to hold them)
* ✅/❌ Cleaning solutions are bulk, cheap and autofeed (but need spot to hold them)
* ❌ Have to prerinse dishes a decent amount (we do that anyways)
* ❌ Expensive: 3-6k range
* ❌ The high temp (non-bleach) sanitizers have hot discharge that needs tempering
